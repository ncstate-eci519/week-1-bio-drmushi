## About Me
Hello! I am a PhD student in the Learning Design and Technology program. I am originally from _Tanzania_ and this is my second semester at NCState. Prior to joining NC State, I have worked as an educational technologist at the _Open University of Tanzania (OUT)_. This in a way explains my interest in e-learning and using technology to enhance teaching and learning processes. 
My **research interests** include studying the potential of learning analytics to support student performance in virtual learning environments. You can read more about me and my background here https://ced.ncsu.edu/news/tag/doreen-mushi/
